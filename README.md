# rubix-cube-solver
Phase 1: Rubix cube implementation and search algorithms. Used Breadth first search and Astar search to determine the effectivness of             search all possibilities for a solution.
Phase 2: Implementation of the neural network and stochastic backpropagation.
Phase 3: Implementation of the genetic algorithm used to train teh neural network.
